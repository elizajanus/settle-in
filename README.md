# settle-in

MOTIVATION
Our team of five was inspired to create settle-in after seeing the flux of housing and the ranging qualities of rentals and landlords/management companies in our city. Settle_in is an app that helps users find roommates based on preferences, entire apartments/houses to rent, sublets, and reviews on landlord/management companies.

FEATURES
Our app allows users to specify their preferences for roommates through the npm surveyjs, and our stellar design is enhanced through use of the Materialize framework.

HOW TO USE
From the index.html choose whether you want to find roommates or information on available housing and landlord/management companies. When using the survey, fill out your own preference information through use of BOOLEANS and then find roommates based on your preferences. For housing, choose whether you want to find an entire house/apartment or just a room, search through our fields for your perfect home, and then be sure to visit the reviews page to see how your landlord/management company measures up.
